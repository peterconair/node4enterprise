## 2.2.1 - 2016-01-29
- Release v2.2.1 / npm@v2.2.1
- resolves [#3](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/parse-function/issues/3 "failing when something after CLOSE_CURLY")

## 2.2.0 - 2016-01-29
- Release v2.2.0 / npm@v2.2.0
- update docs
- add new tests for `valid/invalid`
- add two new properties in result object that are hidden by default: `valid` and `invalid`
  + `valid` **{Boolean}** it is `true` when `val` is function, arrow function or string, `false` otherwise
  + `invalid` **{Boolean}** opposite of `opts.valid`, when `true` the `opts.valid` is `false`
- always return result object with default values, instead of empty object
  + in `v2.0.1` was like that, in `v2.1.0` release that was broken by returning empty `{}` object

## 2.1.0 - 2016-01-27
- Release v2.1.0 / npm@v2.1.0
- update tests
- add two new properties in result object that are hidden by default: `value` and `orig`
  + `value` **{String}** string representation of the given `val`
  + `orig` **{Function|ArrowFunction|String}** original given `val`
- change `arguments` and `parameters` properties to be hidden by default
- add support for arrow functions: now can accept ES2015 arrow functions
- change to now use string looping instead of regex (performance impact?)

> **This release DO NOT have breaking changes!** But because switching from "regex matching" to "string looping" logic it may have performance differences - lower or higher performance. You are encouraged to consider alone which version to use. If you need arrow function support and feel performance hit please open an issue.

> You are encouraged to use this version, because I think it is more stable and faster than previous.  
> If you feel any performance diffs, please open an issue and I will try to solve it.
